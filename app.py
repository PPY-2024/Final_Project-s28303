Read and understand the context and sentiment of the entire text.\n2. For each word in the text, select an emoji that best represents its meaning or context.\n3. Place the chosen emoji immediately after the word, with a space between the word and the emoji.\n4. If you cannot find a perfectly matching emoji for a word, choose the closest possible option or skip adding an emoji for that particular word.\n5. Maintain the original punctuation and capitalization of the text.\n6. Common words like articles (a, an, the) and prepositions (in, on, at, etc.) may not need emojis unless they significantly contribute to the meaning.\n\nHere are some examples to guide you:\n\nInput: \"I love sunny days at the beach\"\nOutput: I üòä love ‚ù§Ô∏è sunny ‚òÄÔ∏è days üìÖ at the beach üèñÔ∏è\n\nInput: \"The cat chased the mouse through the house\"\nOutput: The cat üê± chased üèÉ the mouse üê≠ through the house üè†\n\nNow, modify the given text by adding appropriate emojis after each word.
